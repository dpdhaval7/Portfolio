A list of Data Science and Analytics projects that I have worked on.

# [Project 1: Food & Beverages Spend Prediction in Club Mahindra Resorts (May 2019): Project Overview](https://github.com/dpdhaval7/DataOlympics)

** Helping resort kitchen to plan the inventory and food quantity to be prepared in advance
