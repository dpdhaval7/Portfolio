A list of Data Science and Analytics projects that I have worked on.

# [Project 1: Food & Beverages Spend Prediction in Club Mahindra Resorts (May 2019): Project Overview](https://github.com/dpdhaval7/DataOlympics)
* Created ML model predicting the F&B spend of a member in a resort that would help in improving the pre-sales during resort booking through web and mobile app
* This will further help in:
  * Targeting campaigns to suit the member taste and preference of F&B
  * Providing members in the resort with a customized experience and offers
  * Helping resort kitchen to plan the inventory and food quantity to be prepared in advance
